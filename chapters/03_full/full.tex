\part{Creating Full Documents in \LaTeX}

\section{Starting Point}

\begin{itemize}

\item This section builds off of the previous one which introduced several
  \LaTeX{}~commands.

\item By the end of the last section we had working documents with environments
  and headings that were pleasing to the eye.

\item We will quickly create a very basic document to pick up where we
  left off.

\item Open your text editor and create a new \LaTeX{} file with a \texttt{*.tex}
  file extension wherever is most sensible to you.

\item Create a basic document with the following ``code'' and check that
  it compiles.

\lstinputlisting[caption=\texttt{fakefile3.tex}]{./chapters/03_full/fakefile3.tex}

\item Now, download the two dummy text files from
  \url{https://github.com/olmjo/LaTeX-Intro/tree/master/extra}. They are named
  \verb=loremipsum-short.txt= and \verb=loremipsum.txt=.

\item Place these two files in the same folder/directory as your new \LaTeX{}
  file.

\item As it stands, the document is quite bare. Modify the contents in the
  following way:
  \begin{itemize}

  \item Add \texttt{\textbackslash input\{./loremipsum-short.txt\}}
    on a new line directly after \texttt{\textbackslash section\{Short
      Content\}}.

    That part of your \texttt{.tex} file should look like:

    \begin{lstlisting}
\section{Short Content}

\input{loremipsum-short}
     \end{lstlisting}


     As long as the downloaded file was placed in the
     appropriate place, you can safely ignore what this command does.

   \item Similarly, add \texttt{\textbackslash{}input\{./loremipsum.txt\}} on a new
     line directly after \texttt{\textbackslash{}section\{Long~Content\}}, as in

    \begin{lstlisting}
\section{Long Content}

\input{loremipsum}
     \end{lstlisting}

     As long as the downloaded file was placed in the appropriate place, you can
     safely ignore what this command does.
   \end{itemize}

 \item Compile this document again. You should have a document with a
   considerable amount of filler text in two of the sections.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fonts}

In \LaTeX{} we can make some very basic changes to the font in with ease. These
changes can be made with one of two approaches. The \textit{environment}
approach or the \textit{command} approach.

In the first, whatever font we change will be inside an environment. In the
second, whatever font we change will be the mandatory argument to a command.

\subsection*{Font Styles}
When displaying some text in \textbf{bold face} or \textsc{Small Caps}, we are
changing font styles.

The basic and most common changes are here:
\begin{small}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c c c}
      \hline
      Style               & Environment                                                                          & Command \\
      \hline
      normal/default      & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{textnormal\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{textnormal\}}  & \texttt{\textbackslash textnormal\{\ldots \}}\\
      \textbf{bold}        & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{bf\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{bf\}}  & \texttt{\textbackslash textbf\{\ldots \}}\\
      \textit{italics}     & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{it\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{it\}}  & \texttt{\textbackslash textit\{\ldots \}}\\
      \textsc{SmallCaps}   & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{sc\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{sc\}}  & \texttt{\textbackslash textsc\{\ldots \}}\\
      \underline{underline}&                                none  :-(                             & \texttt{\textbackslash underline\{\ldots \}}\\
      \textrm{Roman}       & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{textrm\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{textrm\}}  & \texttt{\textbackslash textrm\{\ldots \}}\\
      \textsf{Sans Serif}  & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{textsf\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{textsf\}}  & \texttt{\textbackslash textsf\{\ldots \}}\\
      \texttt{teletype}    & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{tt\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{tt\}}  & \texttt{\textbackslash texttt\{\ldots \}}\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{small}

\begin{itemize}

\item Place the \texttt{\textbackslash{}input} command under the ``Short Content''
  section inside a font style environment of your choice. Compile the
  document.

  \begin{lstlisting}
\section{Short Content}

\begin{textsf}
  \input{loremipsum-short}
\end{textsf}
  \end{lstlisting}

\item Before this environment, but under the ``Short Content'' section type and
  complete the following sentence: ``If I had a boat, I'd \ldots''.

  \begin{lstlisting}
\section{Short Content}

If I had a boat, I'd go out on the ocean.
\begin{textsf}
  \input{loremipsum-short}
\end{textsf}
  \end{lstlisting}

\item Finally, change the style of the font for that sentence and only that
  sentence by using the command approach. This time, choose a different style
  from the environment change you made above.

  As an example,

  \begin{lstlisting}
\textbf{If I had a boat, \textit{I'd go out on the ocean}}.
  \end{lstlisting}

  gives

  \begin{center}
    \begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
      \begin{framed}
        \textbf{If I had a boat, \textit{I'd go out on the ocean}}.
      \end{framed}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Sizes}

The size the font can be modified in ways similar to how the font style was
changed.

\begin{small}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c c c}
      \hline
      Style               & Environment                                                                 & Command \\
      \hline
      \tiny{tiny}         & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{tiny\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{tiny\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash tiny\{\ldots\}}\\
      \scriptsize{scriptsize} & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{scriptsize\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{scriptsize\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash scriptsize\{\ldots\}}\\
      \footnotesize{footnotesize} & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{footnotesize\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{footnotesize\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash footnotesize\{\ldots\}}\\
      \small{small} & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{small\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{small\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash small\{\ldots\}}\\
      \normalsize{normalsize} & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{normalsize\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{normalsize\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash normalsize\{\ldots\}}\\
      \large{large} & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{large\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{large\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash large\{\ldots\}}\\
      \Large{Large} & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{Large\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{Large\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash Large\{\ldots\}}\\
      \LARGE{LARGE} & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{LARGE\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{LARGE\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash LARGE\{\ldots\}}\\
      \huge{huge} & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{huge\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{huge\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash huge\{\ldots\}}\\
      \Huge{Huge} & \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{Huge\} \ldots \textbackslash end\{Huge\}}      & \texttt{\textbackslash Huge\{\ldots\}}\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{small}

\begin{itemize}

\item Place the \texttt{\textbackslash input} command under the ``Long Content''
  section inside a font size environment of your choice, but choose a size that
  is smaller than the normal size.

    \begin{lstlisting}
\section{Long Content}

\begin{tiny}
  \input{loremipsum}
\end{tiny}
     \end{lstlisting}

  \item Compile your document.

\end{itemize}

\section{List Environments}

There are three main list environments that you will likely use:
\texttt{itemize}, \texttt{enumerate}, and \texttt{description}.

\begin{description}

\item[\texttt{itemize}] The \texttt{itemize} environment allows you to make
  bullet-ed lists without conveying any order. These can be nested to create any
  structure desired. However, complex nesting often results in user-mistakes.

\item[\texttt{enumerate}] The \texttt{enumerate} environment allows you to make
  numbered lists which convey a precise order. The numbering is
  automatic.\footnote{Like everything in \LaTeX{}, if it is important enough,
    you can override default. But, the guiding ethos of \LaTeX{} is that authors
    not spend long periods of time worrying about format rather than content.}
  These can be nested to create any structure desired and the ``numbering''
  system used at each level reflects how far in the tree the entry is.

\item[\texttt{description}] The \texttt{description} environment is slightly
  different. In fact, I am using it here to describe the different kinds of list
  environments. Instead of each entry being marked with an automatic bullet or
  number, the user must provide the ``term'' being described.
\end{description}

\begin{itemize}

\item For either \texttt{itemize} or \texttt{enumerate} your code
  looks like this, where ``\texttt{environment}'' is swapped out for
  the correct environment:

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
    \begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{environment} % itemize or enumerate
\item An item
\item Another item
\item Still more items!
\end{environment} % again, either itemize or enumerate
\end{verbatim}
    \end{framed}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

\item For the \texttt{description} environment your code is slightly
  different:

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
    \begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{description}
\item[An item] description 1
\item[Another item] description 2
\item[Still more items!] description 3
\end{verbatim}
    \end{framed}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}


\item Create a list in the ``Some Book-keeping'' section. In this list you
  should have two items---two of your favorite books. The environment can be any
  of the three. If you are using the \texttt{description} environment include
  the author's name as the description if you know it. In this case, make sure
  the book title is in square brackets.
\end{itemize}

\section{Metadata: titles, dates, authors, abstracts}
\subsection*{\texttt{\textbackslash maketitle}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Although our content is already impressively long, the document
  is lacking all metadata. To address this we will formally introduce
  the \texttt{\textbackslash maketitle} command
\item In the preamble of the file (that is, before
  \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{document\}}, but after
  \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass}), enter the following code:

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
    \begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
\title{My First Opus}
\date{\today}
\author{Woodrow Wilson}
\end{verbatim}
    \end{framed}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}


\item Compile the document. Notice that \textit{nothing} changes.

\item Now, add \texttt{\textbackslash{}maketitle} on a new line directly after
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{document\}} as in


\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
    \begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}

\title{My First Opus}
\date{\today}
\author{Woodrow Wilson}

% This is just a comment.
\begin{document}

\maketitle
\end{verbatim}
    \end{framed}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}


\item Compile again.

\item Comment out the line with the \texttt{\textbackslash date}
  directive. Re-compile. What results from the following code?

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
    \begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}

\title{My First Opus}
% \date{\today}
\author{Woodrow Wilson}

% This is just a comment.
\begin{document}

\maketitle
\end{verbatim}
    \end{framed}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}


\item Uncomment that same line, delete the directive's single mandatory argument
  and compile. What happens from this code, instead?

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
    \begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}

\title{My First Opus}
\date{}
\author{Woodrow Wilson}

% This is just a comment.
\begin{document}

\maketitle
\end{verbatim}
    \end{framed}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

\item In order to use the \texttt{\textbackslash{}maketitle} command, a title
  must be defined. The author and date, however are optional.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\texttt{\textbackslash{}thanks}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Woodrow Wilson is a humble man and acknowledges the contribution that
  non-Woodrow Wilson entities play in his success. To add this to the title we
  use \texttt{\textbackslash{}thanks}.

\item Include the following line at the end of ``Wilson'' within the author
  command as part of the mandatory argument: \texttt{\textbackslash{}thanks\{The
    author thanks Prospect House for having a sufficiently pretty garden.\}}

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
    \begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
\author{Woodrow Wilson\thanks{The author thanks
 Prospect House for having a sufficiently pretty garden.}
}
\end{verbatim}
    \end{framed}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

\item You can use \verb=\thanks= to include institution information or contact
  information, too. Or, you can use \verb=\footnote= which behaves the same way.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{\texttt{titlepage}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Because this opus is so substantial, it can be overwhelming to
  assault the reader with content on the first page. In this case,
  we'd like to have just a title page.

\item Place the \verb=\maketitle= directive in an environment by the name of
  \texttt{titlepage}

\item Compile the document and see that there is now a title page separated from
  the content itself.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\texttt{abstract}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Even with a title, we might want to convey the content of our document in
  more detail.

\item In this case, we'd use an abstract.

\item After \verb=maketitle= but within the \verb=titlepage= environment, create
  a new environment (which is completely nested) called
  \texttt{abstract}. Within the \texttt{abstract} environment, write two
  sentences about what we have covered in this tutorial, so far. Include the
  word \LaTeX{}, properly typeset.

\item Compile the document.

\end{itemize}

\section{Fancy (and not Fancy) Headers}

\begin{itemize}

\item By default, the only content in the header or footer of our
  document is the page number.

\item We can change this by using a package called \texttt{fancyhdr}.

\item Tell \LaTeX{} to use this package. What is the command? Where
  does it go?

\item In the preamble, also include \verb=\pagestyle{plain}=.  Compile the
  document. What changes?

\item Now use \verb=\pagestyle{fancy}= instead. Compile the document. What
  changes?

\item You can change the contents of the headers and footers by using commands
  of the form \texttt{\textbackslash rfoot\{\}} for \texttt{r} (right),
  \texttt{l} (left), and \texttt{c} (center) ; and for \texttt{foot} (the
  footer) and \texttt{head} (the header).

\item Place the state or non-US country in which you were born somewhere in the
  footer. Compile the document.

\item Notice that the first page, the title page, has no header. Even when we
  use fancy headers and get the pretty content on that first inch of the page,
  any page with \verb=\maketitle= is unchanged, by default.

  We can change this by including \verb=\thispagestyle{fancy}= immediately after
  \verb=\maketitle=.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Introduction to this Short Course}

\paragraph{Purpose.} The aim of this document is to serve as a set of guided
lessons in creating \LaTeX{} documents and to serve as an example of the kind of
documents that can be produced with the \LaTeX{} family of tools. It is not and
does not aim to be comprehensive.

\paragraph{About.} This document was originally prepared by the author during
his tenure as \tsl{} fellow for the incoming graduate student cohort in the
Political Science department at the University of Rochester. Previous versions
of the short course and the corresponding materials are available at \tsl{}'s
website (\url{http://www.rochester.edu/college/psc/thestarlab/}). This document
began as an adaptation of Arthur Spirling's version. It's current version may or
may not have diverged considerably.

In addition to the supplemental files used for the various exercises included in
this version, all files required to create this document are available at
\url{https://github.com/olmjo/LaTeX-Intro}.
